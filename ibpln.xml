  The integration, in the iteration, is divided into a number of increments,
  each resulting in a build, which is integration-tested. This section
  specifies which builds to create and which subsystems will be part of each
  build. For each build, this section needs to specify how the build is
  constructed, the criteria for its assessment and how it is to be tested, in
  particular:

    * Construction

      Build scripts and any other instructions that describe how the build is
      constructed.

      Baseline records that define the versions of the configuration items used
      to construct the build.

    * Evaluation and Test

      Evaluation criteria-a description of the capabilities against which the
      build will be judged. This may contain a subset of the evaluation
      criteria in the corresponding Iteration Plan and other build specific
      evaluation criteria (particularly when, for example, the build is an
      architecture build which does not deliver much, if any capability that is
      visible to the end-user. 

      Installation and setup instructions to execute and test the build.

      Test cases, test procedures, test scripts, and test results.

  Note: In all cases, there is no requirement to replicate material in this
  plan-references will suffice if the material exists in other artifacts; for
  example, the Artifact: Iteration Test Plan.
