    The following is a checklist of items to consider:

      * Requirements Management : Specify the information and control
        mechanisms which will be collected and used for measuring, reporting,
        and controlling changes to the product requirements.

      * Schedule and Budget Control:Describe the approach to be taken to
        monitor spending against the project budget and progress against the
        planned schedule. Describe how to take corrective action when required. 

      * Quality Control:Describe the timing and methods to be used to control
        the quality of the project deliverables and how to take corrective
        action when required. Include techniques, metrics, criteria, and
        procedures used for evaluation— this will include walkthroughs,
        inspections, and reviews. Note that this is in addition to the Test
        Plan, which is not enclosed in the Software Development Plan.

      * Reporting and Measurement: Describe internal and external reports to be
        generated, and the frequency and distribution of publication. Specify
        which metrics should be collected and why.

      * Risk Management: Describe the approach that will be used to identify,
        analyze, prioritize, monitor and mitigate risks. Include a list of
        risks and their current status.

      * Project Close-out: Describe the activities for the orderly completion
        of the project, including staff reassignment, archiving of project
        materials, post-mortem debriefings and reports, and so forth.

      * Configuration Management: Describe the process by which problems and
        changes are submitted, reviewed, and dispositioned. Describe how
        project or product artifacts are to be named, marked, and numbered,
        including hardware, system software, Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS),
        plans, models, components, test software, results and data,
        executables, and so on. Describe retention policies, and the back-up,
        disaster, and recovery plans. Also describe how the media is to be
        retained—online, offline, media type, and format.

      * Problem Resolution: Describe the approach to be taken to resolve
        disagreements with the customer, including how to handle schedule
        slips, scope, and contractual disagreements. 

      * Subcontractor Management: Describe how subcontractors will be managed.

      * Process Improvement Plan: Describe how the effectiveness of the process
        will be assessed and improved.

            packages assigned to individuals. Each individual who is assigned a
            work package provides %completion information to the project
            manager on a weekly basis. Changes in the schedule will be
            escalated to the project sponsors, who will then decide whether to

            Risks will be identified in Inception Phase using the steps
            identified in the RUP for Small Projects activity “Identify and
            Assess Risks”. Project risk is evaluated at least once per
            iteration and documented in this table. The risks of the greatest
            magnitude are listed first in the table.
