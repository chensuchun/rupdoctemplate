  Define the business context for the product. In which domain is it going to
  function (for example, telecom or bank) and what market-who are the users?
  State whether the product is being developed to fulfill a contract or if it
  is a commercial product. If it is a continuation of an existing project, this
  should also be mentioned.

  State the objectives for developing the product-the reasons why this is
  worthwhile. This includes a tentative schedule, and some assessment of
  schedule risks. Clearly defined and expressed objectives provide good grounds
  for formulating milestones and managing risks; that is, keeping the project
  on track and ensuring its success.

  <!--
  For a commercial software product, the Business Case should include a set of
  assumptions about the project and the order of magnitude return on investment
  (ROI) if those assumptions are true. For example, the ROI will be a magnitude
  of five if completed in one year, two if completed in two years, and a
  negative number after that. These assumptions are checked again at the end of
  the elaboration phase when the scope and plan are known with more accuracy.
  The return is based on the cost estimate and the potential revenue estimates.

  The resource estimate encompasses the entire project, through to delivery.
  This estimate is updated at each phase and each iteration, and becomes more
  accurate as each iteration is completed. 

  An explanation of the basis of estimates should be included.

  Express the constraints under which the project is undertaken. These
  constraints impact risk and cost. They could be things like external
  interfaces that the system must adhere to, standards, certifications or a
  technical approach employed for strategic reasons, such as using a certain
  database technology or distribution mechanism.
