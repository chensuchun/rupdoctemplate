      This section has three main purposes: 
        1. It contains a list all artifacts that you Won't use and the motives
           behind your decision for not using them. 

        2. It contains a reference to the project's Configuration Management
           Plan, which describes the configuration management strategy to be
           used when working on these artifacts. The Configuration Management
           Plan allows developers to answer questions such as:  
            * When do I release my artifact?  
            * Where do I put my newly created or modified artifact? 
            * Where do I find existing artifacts for the project? 

        3. If the Development Case is a an organization-level development case,
           this is where you add notes on what each project will consider when
           they decide what to do with the artifact. Use the predefined table

      <title>Artifact Classification</title>

      <para>
        An artifact is a deliverable of the process. It is often developed
        within one core workflow, although there are exceptions. The artifacts
        are organized in the workflow where they are created. To describe how
        an artifact will be used, we use the following classification scheme
        (see Guidelines: Classifying Artifacts for details):

                        * Formal-Internal 
                        * Informal 
                        * None 

                      For details see Guidelines: Review Levels.

                      Also add a reference to the definition and detail of the
                      relevant review procedures. The reference could point to
                      either the Rational Unified Process or to the general
                      Review Procedure section in the Development Case. More
                      specific review procedures are defined under the
                      subsection titled Additional Review Procedures.

  <!--
  This chapter is used for the following purposes:

    * To describe any changes in the set of roles; for example, it is common to
      refine the role Stakeholder into more than one role. 

    * To map job positions in the organization to the roles in the Rational
      Unified Process. The reason for this is that in some development
      organizations there are job positions defined. If these job positions are
      commonly used and have a wide acceptance within the organization, it may
      be worth doing a mapping between the roles in the Rational Unified
      Process and the job positions in the organization. Mapping job positions
      to roles makes it easier for people in the organization to understand how
      to employ the Rational Unified Process. The mapping can also help people
      understand that roles are not job positions, which is a common
      misconception.
