  The introduction of the Business Use-Case Specification provides an overview
  of the entire document. It includes the purpose, scope, definitions,
  acronyms, abbreviations, references, and overview of this Business Use-Case
  Specification.

  Note: If you are not using Rational RequisitePro, then this document template
  should be used to capture the actual Business Use Case including the
  workflow, special requirements, and performance goals of the Business Use
  Case. This file should be linked to the corresponding business use case in
  the Rational Rose model.

  If you use Rational SoDA, then this document is used as input to the business
  use-case report that combines this content with use-case diagrams from
  Rational Rose.
