The purpose of this document is to collect, analyze, and define high-level
needs and features of the System. It focuses on the capabilities needed by the
stakeholders, and the target users, and why these needs exist.  The details of
how the System fulfills these needs are detailed in the use-case and
supplementary specifications.

  The introduction of the Business Glossary provides an overview of the entire
  document. Present any information the reader might need to understand the
  document in this section. This document is used to define terminology
  specific to the problem domain, explaining terms that may be unfamiliar to
  the reader of the use-case descriptions or other project documents. Often,
  this document can be used as an informal data dictionary, capturing data
  definitions so that use-case descriptions and other project documents can
  focus on what the system must do with the information. This document should
  be saved in a file called Business Glossary.

    <!--
    Sometimes it's useful to organize terms into groups to improve readability.
    For example, if the problem domain contains terms related to both
    accounting and building construction (as would be the case if we were
    developing a system to manage construction projects), presenting the terms
    from the two different sub-domains might prove confusing to the reader. To
    solve this problem, we use groupings of terms. In presenting the grouping
    of terms, provide a short description that helps the reader understand what
    a Group Of Terms represents. Terms presented within the group are organized
    alphabetically for easy access.

    Replace the '@@@'s and the text in between with the name of the group.

    Add sections for each group.

  This chapter contains or references specifications of Unified Modeling Language
  (UML) stereotypes and their semantic implications - a textual description of
  the meaning and significance of the stereotype and any limitations on its use -
  for stereotypes already known or discovered to be important in the aspect of
  business being modeled. The use of these stereotypes may be simply recommended
  or perhaps even made mandatory; for example, when their use is required by an
  imposed standard or when it is felt that their use makes models significantly
  easier to understand. This chapter may be empty if no additional stereotypes,
  other than those predefined by the UML and the Rational Unified Process, are
  considered necessary.
