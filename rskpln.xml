  A brief description of the risk management tasks to be performed during the project. In this section, you should describe the following:

    * The approach to be used to identify risks, and how the risk list will be
      analyzed and prioritized.

    * The risk management strategies that will be used, including mitigation,
      avoidance, and/or prevention strategies for the most significant ("Top
      10") risks.

    * How the status of each significant risk and its mitigation activities
      will be monitored. 

    * Risk review and reporting schedules. A risk review should be part of each
      iteration or phase acceptance review.

  A list of the risk items that have been identified. This can be a link to the
  Artifact: Risk List for the project.

  An industry best practice is to publish and keep visible a "Top 10" list of
  risks that are considered significant enough for the project to spend
  resources on their management. You may maintain a longer list if
  organizational practice or the contract requires it.

  Indicators that the risk is being realized and mitigation, avoidance, or
  preventative strategies are identified for each listed risk. Some risks will
  also require a description of the action that is contingent upon the risk
  being realized.
