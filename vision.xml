  To effectively provide products and services that meet your stakeholders' and
  users' real needs, it is necessary to identify and involve all of the
  stakeholders as part of the Requirements Modeling process. You must also
  identify the users of the system and ensure that the stakeholder community
  adequately represents them. This chapter provides a profile of the
  stakeholders and users involved in the project and the key problems that they
  perceive to be addressed by the proposed solution. It does not describe their
  specific requests or requirements as these are captured in a separate
  stakeholder requests artifact. Instead it provides the background and

  <!--
  List and briefly describe the product features. Features are the high-level
  capabilities of the system that are necessary to deliver benefits to the
  users. Each feature is an externally desired service that typically requires
  a series of inputs to achieve the desired result. For example, a feature of a
  problem tracking system might be the ability to provide trending reports. As
  the use-case model takes shape, update the description to refer to the use
  cases.

  Because the Vision document is reviewed by a wide variety of involved
  personnel, the level of detail should be general enough for everyone to
  understand. However, enough detail should be available to provide the team
  with the information they need to create a use-case model.

  To effectively manage application complexity, we recommend for any new
  system, or an increment to an existing system, capabilities are abstracted to
  a high enough level so 25-99 features result. These features provide the
  fundamental basis for product definition, scope management, and project
  management. Each feature will be expanded in greater detail in the use-case
  model.

  Throughout this chapter, each feature should be externally perceivable by
  users, operators or other external systems. These features should include a
  description of functionality and any relevant usability issues that must be
  addressed. The following guidelines apply:
    *	Avoid design. Keep feature descriptions at a general level. Focus on
      capabilities needed and why, (not how) they should be implemented.
    * If you are using the Requisite toolkit, all should be selected as
      requirements of type for easy reference and tracking.
