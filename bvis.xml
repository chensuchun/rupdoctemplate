  To effectively provide products and services that meet your stakeholders' and
  users' real needs, it is necessary to identify and involve all of the
  stakeholders as part of the Requirements Modeling process. You must also
  identify the users of the system and ensure that the stakeholder community
  adequately represents them. This chapter provides a profile of the
  stakeholders and users involved in the project and the key problems that they
  perceive to be addressed by the proposed solution. It does not describe their
  specific requests or requirements as these are captured in a separate
  stakeholder requests artifact. Instead it provides the background and
  justification for why the requirements are needed.
