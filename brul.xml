    Sometimes it is useful to organize Business Rules into groups to improve
    readability. For example, if the problem domain contains Business Rules
    related to both accounting and building construction (as would be the case
    if we were developing a system to manage construction projects), presenting
    the Business Rules from the two different sub-domains might prove confusing
    to the reader. To solve this problem, we use groupings of Business Rules.
    In presenting the grouping of Business Rules, provide a short description
    that helps the reader understand what Group Of Business Rules represents.
    Business Rules presented within the group are organized alphabetically for
    easy access.

    Replace the '@@@'s and the text in between with the name of the group.

    Add sections for each group.
