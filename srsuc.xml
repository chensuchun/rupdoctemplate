Note: The SRS captures the complete software requirements for the system, or a
portion of the system.  Following is a typical SRS outline for a project using
use-case modeling. This artifact consists of a package containing use cases of
the use-case model and applicable Supplementary Specifications and other
supporting information. For a template of an SRS not using use-case modeling,
which captures all requirements in a single document, with applicable sections
inserted from the Supplementary Specifications (which would no longer be
needed), see the file titled srs.xml.

Many different arrangements of an SRS are possible. Refer to [IEEE93] for
further elaboration of these explanations, as well as other options for an SRS
organization.

  The introduction of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) provides an
  overview of the entire document. It includes the purpose, scope, definitions,
  acronyms, abbreviations, references, and overview of the SRS.

  <chapter><!-- Introduction {{{-->
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <!--
    Specify the purpose of this Software Requirements Specification. The SRS
    fully describes the external behavior of the application or subsystem
    identified. It also describes nonfunctional requirements, design
    constraints, and other factors necessary to provide a complete and
    comprehensive description of the requirements for the software.

  This section of the Software Requirements Specification describes the general
  factors that affect the product and its requirements. This section does not
  state specific requirements. Instead, it provides a background for those
  requirements, which are defined in detail in Section 3, and makes them easier
  to understand. Include such items as product perspective, product functions,
  user characteristics, constraints, assumptions and dependencies, and
  requirements subsets.

    <title>Overall Description</title>

    <!--
    If using use-case modeling, this section contains an overview of the
    use-case model or the subset of the use-case model that is applicable for
    this subsystem or feature.  This includes a list of names and brief
    descriptions of all use cases and actors, along with applicable diagrams
    and relationships.  Refer to the Use-Case-Model Survey Report, which may be
    used as an enclosure at this point.

  <!--
  This section of the Software Requirements Specification contains all software
  requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a
  system to satisfy those requirements and testers to test that the system
  satisfies those requirements. When using use-case modeling, these
  requirements are captured in the use cases and the applicable supplementary
  specifications. If use-case modeling is not used, the outline for
  supplementary specifications may be inserted directly into this section.
  -->
  <chapter><!-- Specific Requirements {{{-->
    <title>Specific Requirements</title>

    <!--
    In use-case modeling, the use cases often define the majority of the
    functional requirements of the system, along with some non-functional
    requirements. For each use case in the above use-case model, or subset
    thereof, refer to, or enclose, the use-case report in this section. Make
    sure that each requirement is clearly labeled.

    <!--
    Supplementary Specifications capture requirements that are not included in
    the use cases. The specific requirements from the Supplementary
    Specifications, which are applicable to this subsystem or feature, should
    be included here and refined to the necessary level of detail to describe
    this subsystem or feature.  These may be captured directly in this document
    or referred to as separate Supplementary Specifications, which may be used
    as an enclosure at this point. Make sure that each requirement is clearly
    labeled.

  The supporting information makes the Software Requirements Specification
  easier to use.  It includes:

    * Table of Contents
    * Index
    * Appendices 

  These may include use-case storyboards or user-interface prototypes. When
  appendices are included, the Software Requirements Specification should
  explicitly state whether or not the appendices are to be considered part of
  the requirements.
