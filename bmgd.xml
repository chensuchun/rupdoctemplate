  This chapter contains or references specifications of Unified Modeling
  Language (UML) stereotypes and their semantic implications—a textual
  description of the meaning and significance of the stereotype and any
  limitations on its use—for stereotypes already known or discovered to be
  important for business, in general, or the type of business being modeled.
  The use of these stereotypes may be simply recommended or perhaps even made
  mandatory; for example, when their use is required by an imposed standard or
  when it is felt that their use makes models significantly easier to
  understand. This chapter may be empty if no additional stereotypes, other
  than those predefined by the UML and the Rational Unified Process, are
  considered necessary.
