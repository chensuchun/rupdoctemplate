  This section contains or references specifications of Unified Modeling
  Language (UML) stereotypes and their semantic implications-a textual
  description of the meaning and significance of the stereotype and any
  limitations on its use-stereotypes already known or discovered to be useful
  for the construction of Use-Case models. The use of these stereotypes may be
  simply recommended or perhaps even made mandatory; for example, when their
  use is required by an imposed standard, when it is felt that their use makes
  models significantly easier to understand, or when it ensures that common
  types of entities, roles, relationships, or patterns are uniformly modeled
  and understood. This section may be empty if no additional stereotypes, other
  than those predefined by the UML and the Rational Unified Process, are
  considered necessary.
