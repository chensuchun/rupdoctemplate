  The introduction of the Glossary provides an overview of the entire document.
  Present any information the reader might need to understand the document in
  this section. This document is used to define terminology specific to the
  problem domain, explaining terms that may be unfamiliar to the reader of the
  use-case descriptions or other project documents. Often, this document can be
  used as an informal data dictionary, capturing data definitions so that
  use-case descriptions and other project documents can focus on what the
  system must do with the information. This document should be saved in a file
  called Glossary.

    Sometimes it is useful to organize terms into groups to improve
    readability. For example, if the problem domain contains terms related to
    both accounting and building construction (as would be the case if we were
    developing a system to manage construction projects), presenting the terms
    from the two different sub-domains might prove confusing to the reader. To
    solve this problem, we use groupings of terms. In presenting the grouping
    of terms, provide a short description that helps the reader understand what
    a Group of Terms represents. Terms presented within the group should be
    organized alphabetically for easy access.

    Replace the '@@@'s and the text in between with the name of the group.

    Add sections for each group.

  This section contains or references specifications of Unified Modeling
  Language (UML) stereotypes and their semantic implications-a textual
  description of the meaning and significance of the stereotype and any
  limitations on its useâ€”for stereotypes already known or discovered to be
  important for the system being modeled. The use of these stereotypes may be
  simply recommended or perhaps even made mandatory; for example, when their
  use is required by an imposed standard or when it is felt that their use
  makes models significantly easier to understand. This section may be empty if
  no additional stereotypes, other than those predefined by the UML and the
  Rational Unified Process, are considered necessary.
